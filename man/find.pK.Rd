\usage{
find.pK(sweep.stats)
}
\arguments{
\item{sweep.stats}{pN-pK bimodality coefficient dataframe as produced by
summarizeSweep.}
}
\value{
Dataframe of mean BC, BC variance, and BCmvn scores for each pK
value. Includes mean AUC for each pK value if ground-truth doublet
classifications are utilized during summarizeSweep.
}
\description{
Computes and visualizes the mean-variance normalized bimodality coefficient
(BCmvn) score for each pK value tested during doubletFinder_ParamSweep.
Optimal pK for any scRNA-seq data can be manually discerned as maxima in
BCmvn distributions. If ground-truth doublet classifications are available,
BCmvn is plotted along with mean ROC AUC for each pK.
